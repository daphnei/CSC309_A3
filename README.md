Organization
============

The design document for the assignment can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HFpmnvOQlMa4hCj5ul07yx0Ld2daUcQq2ep0zDEr5TA/edit

This was used as the specification for what features needed to be implemented
for the assignment -- however, all of the pages listed, except for "/favorites",
are accessible without leaving the main page through JQM popups.

Group work was organized using a Trello board:

This, combined with using Git for version control, was effective for ensuring
that all members of the team could be productive without interfering or
overlapping with each other.
